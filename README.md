Kaggle Challenge: Frame-Level Speech Classification

This challenge involves using feedforward neural networks for a speech recognition task. The dataset includes audio recordings (utterances) along with their phoneme state (subphoneme) labels. These recordings are sourced from articles published in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and have been read aloud, with labels corresponding to the original text. The goal is to determine the phoneme state label for each frame in the test dataset, keeping in mind that the utterances vary in length
